AVL Tree
========
( NOTE: I used DevC++ as the IDE when coding. Some of the functions such as getch() is not applicable to
some IDE like Netbeans. If however you would want to use Netbeans, then just change the getch() parts
into a scanf() and debug! :)) 

An AVL tree is a self balancing Binary Search Tree.
It makes your algorithm more stable by making the time effeciency to O(log n).

The Story
---------

My "n00b" implementation of AVL tree in C.
Our final project in data structures requires us to make an implementation of the AVL Tree structure
and be able to defend it.

Though our instructor assigned a different project for me, (B-Tree Implementation)
I still won't leave the chance to implement an AVL tree as I know it will help me up in the future. (errs)

Aside from that, I also want to help my fellow IT schoolmates on their project as they are having a hard time
implementing it. If they would copy the source code from somewhere, it's even more difficult for them as most
of the AVL code are implemented in C++ not in C and have little to no documentation.

So why not I implement it myself and let my schoolmates copy my code and share them how it works. 
It's far better that way :D

Documentation
-------------

You can look at the documentation.md file to read the documentation.
It's not finished yet but I'll be updating it from time to time.

Help and Support
----------------

If you found any bugs or issues with the code, then feel free to post it in the issues tab
or meet me in person at school and I'll help you through it. :)
